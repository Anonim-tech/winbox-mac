#Versioning

A version number uses the following scheme `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

`MAJOR` and `MINOR` versions are always taken from original Windows Winbox. For example, if version of original Winbox is `3.21` then Winbox-mac version will be `3.21.x`.

`PATCH` version will be incremented only when some changed are done to macOS related stuff (not in Winbox.exe).
